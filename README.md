# Pioneer Playlist
This is my EE551 Engineering Python final project

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to have users experience new music by introducing them to artists and songs that are similar to their favorite artists. The user will input their Spotify information and their favorite artist. From there, the program will generate similar songs to that artist. The user will then have the oppurtunity to either turn the list of songs into a playlist or make a new list.

## Architecture Features (Basic Idea)
  * Interface with Spotify API
      * Log-in information
      * Scrap music information
      * Scrap user music taste information
  * Python file that stores song information
  * Randomize songs for playlist
  * GUI for Spotify and playlist name information

## To Do (Basic Idea)
  * Create a user friendly GUI
  * Create an optimal front-end and back-end program
  * Get Spotify API credentials 
  * Have python program interact/connect with the Spotify API
