# Pioneer Playlist
This is my EE551 Engineering Python final project

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to have users experience new music that they wouldn't normally pursue by introducing them to new artists and genres. The user will input a playlist name and their Spotify log-in information. From there, the program will create a Spotify playlist of songs with less than or equal to 150,000 listens. These songs that the program will aggregate will be cross referenced with the user's Spotify data to make sure that the music doesn't match with the users current music taste.

## Architecture Features (Basic Idea)
  * Interface with Spotify API
      * Log-in information
      * Scrap music information
      * Scrap user music taste information
  * Python file that stores song information
  * Randomize songs for playlist
  * GUI for Spotify and playlist name information

## To Do (Basic Idea)
  * Create a user friendly and beautiful GUI
  * Create an optimal front-end and back-end Python program
  * Get Spotify API credentials 
  * Have python program interact/connect with the Spotify API
